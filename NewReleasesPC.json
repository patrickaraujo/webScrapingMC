Just chill!","98":"\"Souennoiseki\" is an adventure game for two players that aims to clear the game by cooperating.\n\nIt is divided into a novel part with a story experience unique to two people, and a puzzle part where you explore the labyrinth and solve the mystery.\n\nLet's work together to clear a puzzle where you can't see each other's screens and need to exchange information over the phone! Let's talk about what you know and what you want to know!
