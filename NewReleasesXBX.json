A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a certain country. The disaster wiped out the financial sector and toppled high-rise buildings over a wide area, even as far as the main functions of the capital. This resulted in the loss of a staggering 158,000 lives.\n\nAt the dawn of the 21st century... Conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, begins reconstruction efforts in the eastern area of said country.

It became the most essential place on the planet and was christened Zone Prime.\n\nThe Rumble Fish is a 2D fighting game. The arcade version was developed in 2004.
